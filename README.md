# Information

Purple Adblock is an adblocker for Twitch which is available on [Firefox](platform/firefox) and [Chrome](platform/chromium). It works by getting the stream from a proxy server, which gives the extension the original stream that doesn't include ads.

## Installation

Download the extension here for: [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/pt-BR/firefox/addon/purpleadblock/) or [Google Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/purple-adblock/lkgcfobnmghhbhgekffaadadhmeoindg).

Download the User Script to use in Tampermonkey: [User Script](https://github.com/arthurbolsoni/Purple-adblock/raw/main/platform/tampermonkey/dist/purpleadblocker.user.js).

It doesn't work with "Alternate Player for Twitch.tv", or other "twitch adblockers", but you can use generic ad blockers like "uBlock Origin".

### How it works

Purple proxies a link of stream through a proxy server, just if it detects an advertisement, it continue streaming from the channel you're watching, therefore avoiding buffering problems in the same connection.
